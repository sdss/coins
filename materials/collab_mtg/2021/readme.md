# 2021 Collaboration Meeting 

## Inclusive Chairing
- Held two 1 hour training sessions the day before the meeting began (one at 9am EDT, one at 4pm EDT) 
- With Chairs, developed a [Zoom Tips Document (PDF)](SDSS2021_ZoomTipsforSessionChairs.pdf)
- Slides (TBD)

## Speed Geeking
- [As in SDSS2020](https://github.com/sdss/coins/tree/main/materials/collab_mtg/2020#speed-geeking), participants were divided into small groups (3-5). Senior collaboration members were shuffled between groups on a 5 minute cycle.  

## COINS Plenary
- Rachael Beaton gave the Plenary talk.

## Career Panel
- [As in SDSS2020](https://github.com/sdss/coins/tree/main/materials/collab_mtg/2020#career-panel), current and former collaboration members formed a panel. 
- [Questions Document](SDSS2021_CareerPanelQuestions.pdf) including questions from 2020 and 2021 panels. 

## Town Hall
- The SDSS2020 Town Hall was a follow-up to the Strike4BlackLives. In 2021, we merged the Meet the Ombuds into this session and wanted to take questions from the audience through Slido ([Event Link](https://app.sli.do/event/wzybf1hk)) and [Slido Report (PDF)](SDSS2021_TownHall.pdf). 
- Questions were answered in real time, with ability of participants to comment. Summaries of responses/discussions were posted in Slack.

### Questions/Comments in Slido:
- What is it like to be a SDSS Mentor for a FAST Team? How do I get involved?
- Do you have recommendations for how things like hybrid meetings (virtual/physical) should be handled? Are there barriers to inclusion there?
- SDSS is a great place to pressure change in conference culture in general on EDI issues -- should extend to shift away from in-person only meetings
- Benefits: environmental and inclusivity (both financial and across other axes of minoritization). Though recognition of those for whom in person is necessary
- I am curious how the EDI practices of SDSS are viewed by the greater astronomical community. Vice versa, do we look at other collaborations as examples?
- Did we see demographic changes in SDSS from 2014 to 2018?
- What are the current focus areas in COINS?
- Any recommendations for COINS V or other inclusive committees?
- Looking back, what would you have done differently as COINS?
- Are COINS involved in decisions over hiring of senior positions in the collaboration? Do you feel that these processes could be made more inclusive? 


## Virtual Thank you Card
- We used google draw to make a "card:" [2021 Thank You Card](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1XVGymmN3h6owCBhRPiliL_b9DonlFGyzJYCTAOdIPvI/edit?usp=sharing)
- Closed Slack Channel for meeting participants not including the Conference Chairs, Local Organizing Committee, and Scientific Organizing Committees.
- Allowed participants to add their messages directly or took messages through Slack or email. 
- Posted PNG to Slack Channel, emailed PDF to Organizers. 

## Post Meeting Survey 
- Run in Survey Monkey from last day of meeting (Aug 17) to Aug 31 (~2 weeks).
