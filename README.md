The Committee On INclusion in SDSS (COINS) was formed to address issues having to do with inclusion in the survey. Our broad goals are to assess the SDSS project and collaborationâ€™s climate and demographics, to recommend to the collaboration management new policies or practices with regard to increasing inclusiveness, and to assist in the implementation of these new activities where necessary. We publicize our findings to the collaboration and ensure that resources that promote inclusivity are widely accessible. We aim to provide the collaboration tools to improve the climate of equity and inclusion.

See the public [COINS ](https://www.sdss.org/collaboration/coins/) site for more details.

This repository is structured as follows:

- **[documents](documents)** - contains policy documents and guidelines drafted by COINS on a variety of topics
- **[materials](materials)** - example materials and templates used for designing inclusive activities
