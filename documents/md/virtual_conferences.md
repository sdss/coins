# Inclusive Chairing Guidelines -- Virtual Meeting Edition

The Committee On INclusion in SDSS has produced a set of guidelines for Committee Chairs that encourage an inclusive meeting. The in-person guidelines are available under [Charing Guidelines](chairing_guidelines.md)


We need to communicate a few tweaks with respect to the online-only conference planned for 2020. 
- Encourage folks to upload a photo to the Zoom account to help with identifying them in the future. 
- It is also useful for those with slower connections that all video is disabled so that the bandwidth is focused on the screen sharing for the talk. 
- Because we don't have name badges and also might not be able to see each other, we want to use the display name in zoom as a virtual name badge. At the beginning of your session, you will need to remind folks to make this modification by clicking on "participants" along the bottom of the screen and then clicking on their own name on the participant list to edit their name. The name change will ensure that pronouns can be used and that the guideline for encouraging ECR participation is adhered to. The changes could be:
  - Add your preferred pronouns, e.g.,  she/her, he/his, they/them
  - Indicate if one is an Early Career Researcher with the letters ECR, which we take to include all students and postdocs
  - Those of us on COINS will also place COINS by our names. 
  - Other leadership can also indicate themselves: AC = Advisory Council, MC = Membership Council, CoCo = Collaboration Council
- We will not have the same physical means of giving/showing/acknowledging time warnings. But it is important that we stick to time for this conference. There is no perfect solution, but we recommend verbally interrupting the speaker with 5/3/1 minute warnings (as appropriate) as the least disruptive option.  Another option is for the chair to change their background to contain a visual time warning, which may work well if all other attendees are muted and the speaker is able to see the chair’s video.  We expect that feedback on these options will shape recommendations throughout the meeting.
- Remind everyone to keep themselves muted (audio and video) throughout the talk (and as hosts, you have the power to mute people, should they forget). --
- Questions should be posted through the zoom chat feature (click on chat on the bottom of the zoom window), preferably only to the Zoom Chair (i.e., not Everyone), to minimize distractions.  The chair should keep in mind the general Chairing Practices when deciding what order to read questions or call on askers.  In general, questions should be held to the end of the talk.  If you run out of time for all questions, encourage the askers and speakers to interact over the session’s slack channel.
- You and your co-chair will work together to balance the various needs of the session. It is hard to listen, pay attention to a timer, keep track of hand raising, mute random people, monitor slack, etc. all at one time! We recommend the following:
 - Speaker Chair: starts the block zoom recording, welcomes the audience, introduces the chairs, reminds the audience to mute themselves and how to ask questions, introduces the speakers, and keeps them on time
 - Zoom Chair: monitors the chat for questions, reads or calls on people for the questions that have been noted in the chat window, monitors the time during the question period
 - Both Chairs: help monitor their session’s slack channel for at least the rest of the meeting, or however long the discussion is active
 - At the conclusion of the meeting, we will run a brief survey to get more feedback regarding "how to get the most out of an e-conference", and we will revise the inclusion recommendations presented here.
