# SDSS Best Practices for an Inclusive Collaboration

SDSS promotes effective communication between its projects and the broad
science community. SDSS welcomes passionate, detailed, thoughtful
disagreement, and discussion about ideas. This free exchange of ideas
and differing perspectives benefits the community and our work. An
inclusive, collaborative, environment is necessary to support a broad,
diverse group of individuals as they contribute their best efforts.

The following document highlights recommended practices to follow for a
rich and respectful collaborative environment. The [SDSS Code of
Conduct](https://trac.sdss.org/wiki/CoCo/CodeofConduct)
describes official SDSS policy towards issues and concerns raised by its
members regarding inappropriate behavior within the collaboration.

## Recommended Guidelines

  **Respect Your Colleague's ...** | **Do** | **Do Not**
  :----: | ---- | ---- |
  Agency | Allow them to express themselves. | Interrupt them nor talk over them.
  Sensibility | Speak kindly and politely. | Say anything to your colleague that you would want said to you in prison.
  Intelligence | Treat them as your equal. | Speak condescendingly to them, nor patronize them.
  Personal Space | Maintain a respectable boundary. | Approach them in extreme proximity, nor engage in any contact considered uncomfortable.
  History | Be considerate towards their personhood. | Assume a history or state of your colleague based on outward appearances or supposed background. You are not aware of their personal experiences and identifications.

## Elements of SDSS Workplace Culture

1.  **Kindness** - SDSS realizes the impact of kindness to empower
individuals to act in ways that strengthen ourselves, our relationships
and our communities.

2.  **Trust** - An inclusive, collaborative environment is best achieved
    when there is mutual trust, based upon honest behavior, throughout
    the community

3.  **Respect** - Inclusive environments foster excellence by
    challenging us to consider a variety of viewpoints and approaches.
    We honor alternate viewpoints as opportunities for discussion and
    learning, and therefore treat others with respect, even if we
    disagree.

4.  **Diversity** - Valuing diversity recognizes differences between
    people and acknowledges that these differences are an asset,
    bringing strength to a community through new ideas, innovation, and
    creativity.

5.  **Inclusion** - By being inclusive, SDSS strives to create an
    environment of involvement, respect, and connection that values and
    benefits from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

SDSS is committed to creating an inclusive, collaborative environment
and endorses guidelines regarding professional behavior, bullying, and
harassment, of the American Physical Society (APS), American
Astronomical Society (AAS). We expect that participants in SDSS will
read and abide by these guidelines, linked below.
