# 2021 SDSS-IV Demographics

Welcome!

Once again, the SDSS is surveying the demographics of its membership.
This is our fifth demographic survey. The results of these and future
surveys will (1) assist the Collaboration in understanding the
involvement of its members, and (2) assist all members in taking maximum
advantage of the opportunities offered within SDSS.

We welcome and appreciate the help of ALL SDSS participants, regardless
of the level of involvement, in sharing their experiences.

All questions are optional. Each question was designed to help address
specific concerns of the Sloan Foundation and the SDSS’s leadership, and
project committees, as well as responding to concerns from the broader
STEM community. We emphasize that the only information besides the
responses provided in this survey being recorded is the timestamp of
submission – no other identifying information is transmitted.

All the information provided is strictly confidential. Statistical
considerations based on the aggregate data from the survey will be
shared with the collaboration, but access to the anonymous responses
will be strictly limited to the members of COINS (Committee on
Inclusiveness in SDSS), who have committed to utmost confidentiality on
the matter.

The length of the survey depends on your participation in SDSS-III,
SDSS-IV, SDSS-V, or all three, and if you have held leadership role(s)
in the survey.

The Survey has the following sections and the number of questions in
each section is given in parentheses: Career Information (3)  
Experience with SDSS (9)  
Demographic Information (10)  
SDSS-III Specific (2)  
SDSS-IV Specific (12)  
SDSS-V Specific (12)  
Impact of COVID19 (5)  
Question Asking (9)  
E/PO Attitudes (4)
